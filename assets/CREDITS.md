# Asset Credits

This file lists the origin and license for each graphical and audio asset shipped with **Stellar Assault**.

## Graphics

All PNG images found in `assets/gfx` and the source images under `assets/Midjourney sprites/` were created by project author **Dariyan Jones** using the Midjourney AI service. The author releases these graphics into the public domain under the terms of the [Creative Commons Zero v1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license.

## Palettes

The palette files in `assets/palettes` are original works by Dariyan Jones and are also provided under the CC0 1.0 license.

## Audio

Sound effects are sourced from the open source **Sci‑Fi Sounds** pack by [Kenney.nl](https://www.kenney.nl/) and are licensed CC0 1.0. These files are included under `assets/kenny assets/Sci-Fi Sounds/Audio/`.

The game references audio exclusively via data files. See `data/sounds.json` for the mapping from logical sound keys (e.g., `laser`, `explosion`, `background`) to the concrete `.ogg` files from the Kenney pack.
